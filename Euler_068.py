# Problem 68
'''I solved this with only pen and paper. I deduced that 10 would have to be on the outside 
to make it a 16 digit number (b/c inner numbers are counted twice and 10 is only number with 
two digits). Then, I tried putting the 5 highest numbers on the outsides, which meant that the
average line score would be 14. Thus, 6 had to go with 5 and 3 on its line. Since 5 coming 
before 3 would make the number higher, I started with 6-5-3, and then I could only find one 
solution that worked from there, which is the one I used (and which worked, thankfully).'''
